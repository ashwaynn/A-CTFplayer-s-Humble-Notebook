## USB Activity Analysis

### USB Mass Storage (USBMS)

For CTF challenges involving the determination of extracted/transferred files to a USB Mass Storage device from the host computer, the following steps are to be followed during the analysis of the provided `PCAPNG` file:

- Select a packet (a row in the `pcapng` file) that has`URB_Bulk out` in the **Info** column and then sort the packets according to their lengths (Length column) **in descending order**.

- This is because **URB Bulk out** frames (packets) are the ones that are used to transfer files from a host computer to an external USB Mass storage device *(and **URB Bulk in** for vice-versa operations)*. 

- When a file is transfered to an external device, **the entire file is transfered in a single *URB Bulk out* frame** and such a frame (packet) housing an entire transfered file **tends to have a bigger packet length** (typically has a packet length of more than 1000 bytes) than other (unimportant) URB Bulk out frames. This is the reason behind setting the packets to be displayed in a descending order based on their `Length`.

- Inspect the **Packet Bytes** section for each frame (that could potentially be containing a file) **for any known file signatures** in the start of the frame. 

- You could also use (and must use) the `file` cmd to help with this determination task. First, click on the `Leftover Capture Data` row in the **Packet Details** section . Then right click on it and select the **Export Packet Bytes...** option. Save the file and run the `file` cmd on it. Change the saved file's extension to the file type determined by the `file` cmd.

- Repeat the above steps to obtain all the files transferred to the external device.
