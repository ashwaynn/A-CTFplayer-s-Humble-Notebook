# SSH

## SSH login using a private key (Public Key Auth)

```bash
chmod 400 id_rsa    
#Private key should be readable only to the owner.

# NOTE: id_rsa is usually present in ~/.ssh

ssh username@10.10.0.1 -i id_rsa
```

## Appending an algo to the list of Host Key Algorithms used by SSH

```bash
ssh username@10.10.5.198 -p 2222 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa
```


## SSH Local Port Forwarding

```bash
ssh -L 5566:127.0.0.1:10000 agent47@10.10.67.67

# 5566 is a local port

sudo ssh -L 0.0.0.0:80:172.20.128.2:80 entry@10.10.109.140

# sudo is needed to bind to the local port 80
```
