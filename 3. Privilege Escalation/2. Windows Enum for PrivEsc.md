# Windows Enumeration Techniques for PrivEsc

## Basic Commands


```bash
# Getting the system details:
systeminfo

# Getting the current user's name
whoami

# Getting the current user's privileges
whoami /priv

# Getting the current user's groups
whoami /groups

# Getting all the user accounts on the computer
net user

# Getting the members of the 'Administrators' group

net localgroup Administrators

# Note: Always check the list of the groups on the system using the below cmd as the admin group might be spelt differently based on the system's language setting (such as Administradores)

net localgroup
```

> ### *NOTE :* <u>Common PrivEsc Technique</u> - Adding a user to the 'administrators' group (while running the command as system)

```bash
net localgroup Administrators <USERNAME> /add

# Check the list of groups on the system before executing the above cmd.
```

## Investigation of the network ports 

```bash
netstat -ano
```

`-a` - For all connection established as well as listening ports.

`-n` - Numerical representaion of address and ports.

`-o` - Displays the process ID of the associated process.

## Common locations to look for applications installed on the system

```bash
# Default Location
C:\Program Files\

# Location for 32-bit apps on 64-bit Windows.
C:\Program Files (x86)\
```

Try to determine the versions of the installed apps (by looking into files such as README files, etc.) and lookup online for **any potential exploits for the installed versions**.
