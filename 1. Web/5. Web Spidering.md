## CeWL

### Custom Wordlist Generation

```bash
cewl <URL> -w extracted-words.txt
```

`-w` specifies the **O/p file**.

**TIP :** You can use the cmd `wc -l extracted-words.txt` to quickly see the number of words (present as individual lines in the file) extracted by `cewl` from the target website. 

### Emails Extraction

```bash
cewl <URL> -e -w extracted-words.txt --email_file extracted-emails.txt
```

`-e` specfies to additionally perform emails extraction from the target website.

`--email_file` specifies the **O/p file for the extracted emails**. If not used, then the extracted emails are added to the file containing the extracted words.
